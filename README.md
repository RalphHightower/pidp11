# Install instructions

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp11.git
    /opt/pidp11/install/install.sh

Note that you do not necessarily need to have the PiDP-11 hardware. This will run on any Pi, but you have to tell it which OS you want to boot from the command ine rather than from the front panel. See the manual for a how-to: https://obsolescence.dev/pidp11/PiDP-11_Manual.pdf

# Move to Github & the previous install package

We moved to Github only in November 2024. Before then, the install was done through downloading a tarball. You might still see references to that install method here and there. Both methods work fine - this Github version of the software contains some small extras though.
